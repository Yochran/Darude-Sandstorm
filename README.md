# Darude-Sandstorm
Stupid JS program that in theory goes through the comment section on a youtube video and if one of the comments contains the regex "what" and "song", it replies darude sandstorm under a new account.

### Disclaimer:
On the real YouTube.com site, this will not actually work because I coded the "comments" to just be simple JSON storage. If you actually want something like this to work on YouTube for real, you'd need your own custom YouTube.js class.
